Our farm was established in 2000 and started out with newlyweds, a couple horses, three cats and three German Shepherds.   When we first moved in the most excitement you would find was the weekend tractor excursion into the woods to find firewood for the season or the occasional trail ride.   Today the farm has grown significantly and is home to Shepherds Watch Apiary, Emily's Eggs and Shepherds Watch Nubians.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/310f070f-ef0a-4542-84b7-aa1028b78524.gif)

The Shepherds will be the first to greet you with a noisy announcement of your arrival and wagging tails.  Dreamer and Maddie are the guardians of the farm and look out for the critters big and small.  They are 9 years old and may be slowing down a hair but take their job very seriously.  If Ed is outside the dogs will be at his heels waiting to see what that day's projects will be.  Maddie has become best buds with our buck Striker and when he is turned out in the morning she must be in the field too.  I'm not sure if she thinks she's a goat or he's a dog but they are great fun to watch.  Some afternoons you'll find them soaking up the sun in the field together enjoying an afternoon siesta.  Dreamer is a little to dignified for that and keeps watch from the center of the yard where she can keep everyone in sight and monitor them.   Our third dog Penny cannot be forgotten.  She is not a shepherd and her face is as homely as theirs is beautiful but she adopted us and is a welcome member of the family.  She is a Dogue de Bordeaux (Think Hooch from Tom Hanks movie Turner and Hooch) band is the self appointed nanny of the farm.  Any baby on the farm is carefully followed around by Penny until she deems them big enough to fend for themselves.

On any given day you will find over 30 free range chickens scratching happily in the yard or dust bathing.  During the Spring and Summer we are rewarded with a large variety of brown and blue-green eggs.  Our daughter Emily is in charge of their care and sells their eggs to help pay for their upkeep.  Every chicken has a name and distinct personality.  If you visit the farm you will be greeted by a mooching chicken or two looking for a handout.  They will tell you they are starving and need bread or they will perish but don't believe them.  Their chubby bodies will tell the truth of how spoiled they are.  We have a variety of breeds from the more common Rhode Island Reds and Americaunas to the less common breeds of Cochin, Brahma and Salmon Favorelles.  We even have a one legged chicken that beat all the odds when she was a few days old and now has her own protected area she shares with random girlfriends up by the house so she doesn't become easy prey for the fox and hawks that live in the woods.  She comes when called if she is in the hay bales with the other chickens and get a ride up to the front pen every morning with her scratch and feed for the day (hard to scratch four bugs with only one foot). ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebdddbe8-1a4b-488e-a84f-488c36bd579c.jpg)

Our apiary started in 2011 when Ed began using honey on everything...peanut butter and honey sandwiches, cereal with honey...you get the idea.  We ordered our first two nucleus hives and thought we'd like to end up with three or four hives.  Currently we are at 41 and our new goal is to add 12-15 overwintered nucleus hives to our inventory each year so we can meet the demand for nuc purchase requests we receive each Spring.  We refer to this addition phenomenon as bee and chicken math.  Any farmer is usually a quick study at this math technique, 1 + 1 never equals 2\.   The simple equation of 1+1 morphs to 1+ 1(x some multiple of craziness) = more than you anticipated.  LOL  We usually get some funny looks when we mention we are bee keepers but most people usually end up thinking it's pretty cool and who can resist their yummy honey? ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/704d87a6-a054-4653-9338-d044f29d4883.jpg)

The most recent addition to our farm in 2014 and 2015 were three adorable Nubian goats Edith, Ethel and Striker.  A goat was the last thing I wanted to add they are naughty, break fences and play too rough.  Boy did they prove me wrong!  Edith is extremely social and if you sit down with her you will soon find her seated in your lap asking for a cuddle or for you to scratch an itchy spot for her.  Ethel is more subdued and a little bit shy but very sweet and has an adorable little face.  Striker is our handsome and playful boy who came to us from Hoanbu Farm in Ohio.  He is our herd sire and we have babies on the way in mid-May.  His first babies will make their appearance mid-April when Etta and Echo (our girls sisters) have their kids.  Stay tuned for baby pictures soon!
