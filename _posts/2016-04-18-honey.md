Bulletcreek Secret 2 A Galaxy

Spring on the farm is an exciting time of new life and new beginnings. We are waiting to pick up our new little doelings from Bulletcreek Farm in TN. They come from great conformation and milking lines and will be a great addition to our breeding program. Edith and Ethel look ready to pop and have just a month to go before we welcome our first babies to the farm.

Striker will be a daddy any day now. Etta is due on the 19th and Echo is due in two weeks. (Edith and Ethels sisters)

Stay tuned to see
