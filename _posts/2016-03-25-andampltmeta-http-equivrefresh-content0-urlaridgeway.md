I don't often pay too much mind to Facebook posts but a friend shared something on my page that hit home so I thought I'd share it here so it didn't get lost amidst the cartoons, political rants and recipes... 

**"Quite regularly, someone seems to say to me "Oh but doesn't that farm and all those animals really tie you down?" Why yes, yes they do.... **

**They tie me to starting my day when the sun rises and ending it well after the sun sets...but it means I always get to see them both. They tie me to the rhythm of the seasons...the might of the winter blizzard, the first spring breeze carrying the scent of rain, the towering glory of a summer thunderhead and the fall of leaves from the poplar trees. They tie me to concentrating on the chores that need to be done right now...not the regrets of yesterday nor the worries for tomorrow. This farm and all these animals keep me tied down to earth when the rest of of the universe tries to flip me upside down. And so I would much rather be tied down here than set adrift in the tumultuous sea I see so many others in. I find this mooring rather to my liking."**

I have the privilege of be "tied to this farm" with my husband. We have great adventures here together from peaceful walks in the woods observing God's creation to sweating all day in the sun digging post holes and laying new fence line for the critters.  We get to watch our kids enjoy the animals, bond with them, care for them and learn responsibility.  Ed's an early bird and is up at the crack of dawn letting me get a few extra winks of sleep.  We work hard all day sometimes together sometimes on our own tasks but always find time to connect by the end of the day.  I'm not sure the kids appreciate the extra chores now but I know when they are grown they will have great memories of their childhood on the farm.  Cuddling with 120lbs goats that think they only weigh 10 lbs and still fit in your lap.  Walking by the kitchen door and seeing 8 chickens on your back step begging for a snack. Walking up the driveway and having all 30+ follow you to get some scratch.  Honey fresh from the comb is worth all the backbreaking work and boy oh boy,  do you acquire some funny stories when working with thousands of stinging insects.  Sleeping in the barn for several nights during the coldest winter weather willing a goat with pneumonia to fight and get better is rewarded by having a new best friend that will be having babies in May and providing fresh milk to our family.

Are we tied down?  Sure our schedule is limiting but it has provided us a stable, secure home
